//! Per-upload-event records — the moderation side channel.
//!
//! Content-addressed storage keys facts about *bytes*; moderation and legal
//! reporting (e.g. NCMEC CyberTipline) need facts about *upload events*: who
//! uploaded, when, from which network address. This module writes one small
//! append-only JSON record per **accepted** upload — including the idempotent
//! re-upload short-circuit, which does no blob PUT and is therefore invisible
//! to any blob-creation-driven pipeline.
//!
//! Key layout (alongside the existing `_meta/` sidecar convention):
//!
//! ```text
//! _uploads/{community}/{sha256}/{event_id}.json
//! ```
//!
//! `event_id` is a ULID — unique and time-sortable, one record per accepted
//! upload event. Records are unreachable through the media serve path by
//! construction (`validate_media_path` requires a bare 64-hex first segment),
//! and the bucket is only accessible via the relay's IAM role.
//!
//! The whole feature is **off by default** and gated behind
//! `BUZZ_MEDIA_UPLOAD_RECORDS`. IP collection is a second, independent opt-in
//! (`BUZZ_MEDIA_UPLOAD_IP_HEADER`) and is *fail-empty*: a missing, malformed,
//! or non-public address records nothing — a wrong IP is worse than no IP,
//! so absent is always preferable. The IP goes only into this
//! record — never blob metadata, never the upload response, never the
//! hash-chained audit log.
//!
//! ## Consumer contract (buzz-moderation)
//!
//! The moderation pipeline triggers on `ObjectCreated` events under the
//! `_uploads/` prefix and parses this record instead of HEADing blobs:
//!
//! - For fresh uploads, the record is written after immutable blob staging and
//!   the canonical PostgreSQL publication commit, but before cache projections.
//!   Record existence therefore implies the scan inputs are readable. A record
//!   failure leaves the DB-witnessed object authoritative but unprojected for
//!   moderation retry; a sidecar never grants canonical visibility.
//! - `ext`, `mime_type`, and `size` are always present so the consumer can
//!   derive the blob key (`{sha256}.{ext}`) and scan eligibility without
//!   extra round-trips.
//! - `uploader_name`, `ip`, and `port` are omitted (never `null`) when
//!   unknown or when collection is disabled.
//! - Consumers must tolerate unknown fields; `version` bumps only on
//!   breaking changes to existing fields.
